# Survey Feedback - Week 2
## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

This week's pace was much better. Having the full day lab on Sunday was super helpful!

I really loved the live coding exercise. Seeing someone walk through an entire project, piece by piece, was really helpful to me.

Having lots of extra time to focus on lab work. Gives me time to soak up the new material and look over starter-code examples to figure out what we are supposed to be learning.

The pair assignments have been immensely helpful! Oh and Sundays all day lab as well.

Demonstrations of the codes effect on the DOM is best for my learning style, coupled with reinforcing the lesson with an exercise, using the material just learned.

I really liked the switch to a full day of labs on Sun. Doing that this past Sun finally gave me a chance to have a nice large block of time dedicated to getting caught up on my portfolio as well as fix some stuff in the pair-assignment.

The whole Sunday dedicated for portfolio assignment was very helpful.

I really enjoy the experience of pair programming! The lab time for working on personal portfolio project was a welcome relief...

I really liked the deep dive on ajax, although it was a lot of information. I kind of hope we get to go over it again.

Learning both how to use handlebars and markup as well as just learning how to implement libraries in general was great and i'm sure is going to be incredibly useful in the future


## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

This week was a great week. Lots of lab time really allowed me to explore jquery and front end design, instead of just focusing on the assignment requirements. I was able to complete the assignment and then continue exploring the code pressure free. In the end, I ended up throwing away some of my experiments, but that was okay, because I learned a lot and had already completed the core assignment requirements.

The "workshop" didn't work out so well. I really didn't like just copying down the code. I felt lost the whole time and had to go over it on my own afterwards during a lab to really get it. I still don't have a good grasp of Highlight.js and markup

I guess this is technically for the coming week...but I'm not looking forward to switching up the pairs. My current partner and I have found a rhythm that works fantastic for us and we've both come to know each others strengths and weaknesses. I'm a little worried that switching up partners now is going to slow things down a bit while everybody readjusts. With that said, there are a couple of people that I would love to have the chance to work with because I love their approach to some things.

The workshop on adding a form to the blog was a little hard to follow. Not sure if the code was too advanced for the level we are currently at, or what. (I haven't finished the assignment yet).

I'm not sure the in class work-along was all that helpful, even accounting for the bumpy start i'm still not sure what typing along in class was supposed to accomplish


## DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

I'd like a review of Highlight.js and markdown

I wish there were more hours in the day that I could focus on this. I almost resent my paying job for taking me away from this experience.

I learn best when I have to figure something out myself so the combo of lecture and lab is really great. I think if given a bit of time during class to play around with the code ourselves or problem solve might help, while it is still fresh. I don't know if that is something anyone else would want, but just an idea.
