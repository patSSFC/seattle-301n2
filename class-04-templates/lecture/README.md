### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
As somebody who has NOT previously taken a CF course what I found most helpful was the review of Github. While I was self studying I was using github but I never had to collaborate with anybody so using it here at CF was a different beast. But the review we did on the first day was helpful and set me up well for pair assignments

The pair assignments have been incredibly helpful!

Having the lab be "mandatory" has been great. It really gives time for us to work on stuff.

Learning jQuery!

Jquery is really helpful, once you get your head around the way selectors work.

The pair programming, the lectures, the lab time, the personal interactions with the other students, the teacher and TA's (Brian and Austin), the readings. The online resources, setting up my dev environment and starting the coding!

I like working with a partner on assignments. It's always helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of.

Lots of lab time!

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
Nada!

So far this week everything has been equally helpful.

It's all been pretty useful so I can't complain.

Having a pair-programming assignment during every lab makes it difficult to complete the reading and portfolio assignments. While I understand the importance of pair-programming, I don't feel that it is necessary to one every lab. Having all-day lab on Sunday is great for catching up on work but the reading assignments often directly correlate with the pair-programming assignment or the portfolio assignment so getting the readings after the fact is not helpful.

CSS still isn't fun

I am struggling with the github workflow for pair programming. I really could have used a more focused review of how this workflow would work, meaning that I really could have used a demo by the teacher and a TA for how to set up the shared repo and then how to pull down the projects, how to switch from driver to navigator and back, how to make the pull requests... just walking through the process showing the commands used on the terminal and talking about it would have really helped immensely. I know it is a confusing topic, so the more light shed on it the better, for me. The first portfolio project was assigned too soon, I think. Perhaps after the pair programming had progressed a few steps, then introduce the portfolio assignment.

I found all of it pretty helpful.

All was helpful.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?
If possible, split up the pair-programming to be every other lab.

Things seem to be moving so quickly that I'm doing my best to keep up with the pace of all knowledge and resources being presented. I'm doing OK so far, it's a great ride. As I mentioned above, my biggest concern right now is getting the github workflow down, since it's slowing me down in submitting assignments (PRs).

Not at the moment.
